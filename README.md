An answer that involves mostly code is the best candidate to be here.

A non-code answer may also be found here if it is considered to have some educational value and/or it combines and consolidates some researched content. The `README.md` of a non-code answer may inlcude the complete answer along with a synopsis of its question. The code snippets included in such answers may also be included as separate files.
