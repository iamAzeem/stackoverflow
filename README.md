## What kind of answers are here?

An answer that involves mostly code is the best candidate to be here.

A non-code answer may also be found here if it is considered to have some educational value and/or it combines and consolidates some researched content. The `README.md` of a non-code answer may inlcude the complete answer along with a synopsis of its question. The code snippets included in such answers may also be included as separate files.

## How to navigate?

- Go to the `questions` folder.
- Choose a subfolder representing a particular [category](#how-the-categorization-works) i.e. language/tool/technology.
- Each subfolder represents an SO thread.
- The subfolder's name represents the question ID.
- Use this question ID to nagivate to its SO thread on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Format: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/`<kbd>question-id</kbd>

Example: [`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44558568`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44558568/)

### Bountied Questions

A Bountied Question's folder is marked as <kbd>(bountied)</kbd> following its <kbd>question-id</kbd> like this:
```
/questions/<language>/<question-id> (bountied)
```

### How the categorization works?

The questions are broadly categorized according to language, tool and technology.

A question of the nature `How to do <something> in <language>/<tool>?` resides under its respective language/tool folder e.g. `cpp`, `bash`.

A question involving multiple languages, tools and technologies such as QML (Qt/C++), WebAssembly (C++/JavaScript), etc. may be found under its respective technology folder e.g. `qml`, `webassembly`.
